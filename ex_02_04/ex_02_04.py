# Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:width = 17, height = 12.0. For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

width = 17
height = 12.0

ex1 = width // 2
ex2 = width / 2.0
ex3 = height / 3
ex4 = 41 + 2 * 5

print(ex1, type(ex1))
print(ex2, type(ex2))
print(ex3, type(ex3))
print(ex4, type(ex4))
