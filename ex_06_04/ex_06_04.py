# There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise. Write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in "banana"
print('banana'.count('a'))


# my code with added user input:
word = input('Enter word:')
searched = input('Enter letter:')

print(word.count(searched))
